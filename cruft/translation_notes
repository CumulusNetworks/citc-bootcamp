1). On oob-mgmt-server, where is id_rsa.pub? I can't regen it, would rather not create new keys.

echo "Copying Key into /var/www/html..."
cp /home/cumulus/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /var/www/html/authorized_keys
chmod 777 -R /var/www/html/*


2). How is NAT working in this environment... I see Leafs can ping google over Eth0


3). is /etc/network/interfaces on oob-mgmt-server always fixed?
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
  address 10.255.0.1
  netmask 255.255.0.0
  gateway 10.255.0.3
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
    address 192.168.0.254
    netmask 255.255.0.0
